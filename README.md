# PN5180 NFC Reader - Fix Duplicated UID Issue

## 📋 Overview
A robust solution for reading NFC cards (ISO14443A) using the PN5180 module, specifically addressing a critical bug in standard libraries that causes duplicated UID readings. This implementation ensures each NFC card returns its correct, unique UID every time.
## ⚠️ The Problem: Duplicated UID Reading
When using standard PN5180 libraries, users encounter a critical bug:
- Different cards showing the same UID - Multiple distinct cards return identical UID values
- Same card showing different UIDs - A single card returns varying UIDs on consecutive reads
- Invalid UIDs - Readings of all zeros (0x00) or all ones (0xFF) that don't correspond to actual cards
## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The core problem lies in the standard PN5180 library's insufficient handling of the FIFO buffer between read operations:
- Insufficient FIFO buffer clearing - The readCardSerial() function doesn't reset the PN5180's internal FIFO buffer before new read operations
- Missing data validation - No proper validation of ATQA and SAK responses before processing UID data
- Incomplete error checking - Lack of validation for manufacturer codes and UID structure
## 🛠️ Solution: Enhanced Direct Buffer Processing
Instead of relying on the flawed readCardSerial() function, we implemented a direct approach using activateTypeA() with comprehensive validation:
Key Improvements:
- Direct FIFO Buffer Management
- Comprehensive Data Validation (ATQA, SAK, UID structure)
- Enhanced Error Detection with specific error codes
- Periodic Hardware Reset to ensure clean state broadcasting.
